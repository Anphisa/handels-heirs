# Concert Programme Visualizer/Generator
This Python program decodes a dataset of concert programmes (http://research.gold.ac.uk/10342/). This makes the content machine readable. 
The cleaned concert programmes are saved in /DataFrames. Please also read the included *manual_review.md* for more information.
