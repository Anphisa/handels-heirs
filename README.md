# Concert Programme Visualizer/Generator
Data cleansing part of [The Concert Programmes Project](https://thedataalligator.com/concert-programmes/).

These Python scripts decode a dataset of concert programmes (http://research.gold.ac.uk/10342/). This makes the content machine readable. 

The cleaned concert programmes are saved in /DataFrames. Please also read the README file in /DataFrames for more information.
