# Manual review of concert information
This is manually reviewed concert information.

* Files generated by ProgrammeDecoder are *concerts_df.csv*, *meta_information_df.csv*, *musical_pieces_df.csv*, *other_information_df.csv*, *pauses_df.csv*.

   These are created by running *main.py*. You will have to supply the source files (McVeigh calendar of London concerts 1750-1800).
   
   
* Files changed by manual review have suffix *_cleaned_df.csv*.

   These are created by using *man_review.py* to change concert information manually. The log of those changes can be found in *manual_review.log*.
   However, these files also include manual changes that have been effectuated by other means. (e.g. LibreOffice)
   The files contain less information than the original dataset, since not all information easily fits into data scheme.
   The most recent files are in main folder, older versions can be found in *older_versions/* folder.
